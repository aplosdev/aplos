# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to Aplós! This project is open-source and welcomes contributions from everyone. By participating, you are expected to uphold this [code of conduct](https://github.com/aplosdev/aplos/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

If you're new to contributing to open-source projects, you can start by checking out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests) on how to contribute to a project.

## General Guidelines

- Ensure that your pull request is up-to-date with the `main` branch.

- Make sure that your code is well-documented and follows the [conventional commit guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

- Ensure that you've formatted the code using `pnpm format`.

The project is still in its early stages, so these guidelines aren't that strict. However, it's recommended to follow them to make the contribution process smoother, and the Developer Experience better.

## Contributing to the main repository (aplosdev/aplos)

If you want to contribute to Aplós, you can clone the repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aplosdev/aplos.git
```

Before you start developing, make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

If you want a development server, you can directly run the Docs for development using the following command:

```bash
pnpm docs:dev
```

You can edit the project and see your changes live.

All other standard VitePress commands are available, like `pnpm demo:build` and `pnpm demo:preview`.
