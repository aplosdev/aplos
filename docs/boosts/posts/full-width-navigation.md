If you want a more classic navigation style, you can make it full-width. To add the plugin, simply add the plugin's name to the `boosts` array in the `config.mts` file. The plugin will be automatically added to the navigation.

Plugin Name:

```txt
full-width-nav
```

## Example of the Configuration

```ts
  boosts: [
    "full-width-nav",
  ],
```
